# Contribution guidelines #

[![Chat on Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/cristim/autospotting.svg)](https://gitter.im/cristim/autospotting?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge)

The usual GitHub contribution model applies, but if you would like to [raise an
issue](https://github.com/cristim/autospotting/issues/new) or start working on a
[pull request](https://github.com/cristim/autospotting/pulls), please get in
touch on [gitter](https://gitter.im/cristim/autospotting) to discuss it first so
we make sure everything is clear and that nobody else is working on it.

Any random questions are also better asked there.

## Feature requests ##

The use case should be presented in detail in the issue, and should also
be discussed on gitter to make sure nothing was lost in translation.

## Bug reports ##

Bug reports should contain enough details to be reproduced by a developer.

The commonly required information is already pre-filled when creating any GitHub
issue, but be prepared to provide more when asked, either in the issue comments
or on gitter.

## Contribution standards ##

The non-trivial code contributions need to provide unit tests for the
functionality being changed.

All the pull requests will need to pass a review by the maintainers before they
can be merged. Be prepared to iterate your pull request until it is ready to be
approved, which may take a while for bigger contributions.

Pull requests should also have a corresponding issue linked to them so it is
clear what problem they are solving.
